Yes, companies need to access your abilities, but coding interviews invade your privacy. Just imagine, someone looking at how you think and what your motives are regarding input from a test question.<br />People think differently and people have different processes. But the bottom line should be &ldquo;what can this person accomplish&rdquo;. I mean, who types algorithms without lookup in any instance. We lookup everything, one, to make sure it&rsquo;s the right way to do it, and two, to make sure we are not crazy in thinking we can do it [the method] the way we think the language should allow.<br />Yes, there are hundreds of methods which any language will allow on any type, and yes, there are hundreds of things programmers can memorize but to recall them in an instance should be  considered insane (especially when someone is watching over you).<br />Give us a take home test [to create an app], and time that. This will give you a good idea of what we can do. Oh yeah, let us work remotely in cities which have terrible commutes. </span>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Initial Post</title><dc:subject>Articles</dc:subject><dc:date>2019-11-13T10:30:49-08:00</dc:date><link>https://arindavoodian.github.io/blog/files/a73a0fd1cedcd6cf3632e7bd01bc3b59-2.html#unique-entry-id-2</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://arindavoodian.github.io/blog/files/a73a0fd1cedcd6cf3632e7bd01bc3b59-2.html#unique-entry-id-2</guid><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is just the initial post for my portfolio blog? I guess it is. Anyway just testing functionality before posting anything else. Although, this may be a good opportunity to practice typing words for no good reason, I mean; it's either that or code.]]></content:encoded></item></channel>
